# tech-nonsense

A [Markov chain](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/markov_chains) based tech-nonsense generator.

#### Examples
- embrace feature-rich clustering
- target open-source supervised learning
- repurpose peer-to-peer computing
- embrace bleeding-edge metrics
- brute-force open-source disk encryption
- reinvent feature-rich recursive neural networks
- elegant turn-key hashing
- massive neural networks
- cultivate back-end cryptocurrency
- monetize mission-critical bot-nets
- unleash plug-and-play paradigms
- brute-force exhaustive hyper-cloud
- byzantine supervised learning
- feature-rich recursive neural networks
- target user-centric paradigms

## Algorithm

1. Randomly combine nouns, verbs and adjectives into sentences of:
   - verb adjective noun.
   - adjective noun.
2. Feed the sentences into the Markov chain to train it.
3. Use the Markov chain to generate sentences that:
   - end with a period.
   - are not too short.
